BONUS: 

Research a loop so that your condition runs on every number from 0 to 100
var i;
for (i = 0; i <= 100 ; i++) { 
  console.log(i);
}

Research a function so that your condition runs on every number from 0 to whatever number is passed into the function
function loopFunction(num) {
var i;
for (i = 0; i <= num ; i++) { 
  console.log(i);}   
}
